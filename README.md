# A-28 Project: UVA AI Maps

A webapp that uses Google Maps and an AI chatbot to help UVA students choose locations on grounds for food, studying,
etc. based on their class schedule.

To use the app, first upload a calendar and await admin approval for your events (you can become admin using the
dropdown menu in the bottom left). Then, ask the AI chatbot for any advice for things to do around grounds
before or after your calendar events. You will receive recommendations based on your schedule, and those recommendations
will be reflected on the map.

You can use the provided map filters to search for places to study, eat, or relax. Additionally, you can view
favorite locations submitted by other users and add your own favorite locations if you wish.

For full functionality of the webapp, you will need a .ics calendar file as formatted when downloaded from SIS. If you
have no such calendar available, an example one can be found here:

Please note that this calendar only has events on weekdays, and as such no events will be displayed on weekends.
